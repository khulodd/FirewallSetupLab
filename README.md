## Configuring Linux and Windows Firewalls

### Lab Summary

During this lab, I gained hands-on experience in configuring Linux and Windows firewalls to enhance network security. This summary provides an overview of the tasks performed and the knowledge acquired.

### Linux Firewall Configuration

In the Linux portion of the lab, I focused on configuring the firewall on a Kali virtual machine. The following steps were taken:

- Logged into the Kali VM and obtained the IP address of the eth0 network interface.
- Added firewall rules to allow loopback traffic.

- Configured rules to block specific websites.

### Windows Firewall Configuration

In the Windows firewall section, I focused on configuring the built-in firewall settings. The following steps were performed:

1. Accessed the Windows Firewall settings through the Control Panel.
2. Created outbound rules to block access to a specific website.
3. Configured inbound and outbound rules to restrict all applications from accessing the internet.

### Conclusion

Through this lab, I obtained practical knowledge in configuring and managing Linux and Windows firewalls. I learned how to allow or block specific traffic, secure network interfaces, and restrict access to websites and applications. This experience will enable me to strengthen network defense and protect against unauthorized access.
